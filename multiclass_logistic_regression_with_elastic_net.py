"""
Multiclass Logistic Regression With Elastic Net.

Multiclass classification is supported via multinomial logistic (softmax) 
regression. In multinomial logistic regression, the algorithm produces K sets 
of coefficients, or a matrix of dimension KÃ—J where K is the number of 
outcome classes and J is the number of features. If the algorithm is fit with 
an intercept term then a length K vector of intercepts is available.

Multinomial coefficients are available as coefficientMatrix and intercepts are 
available as interceptVector.

coefficients and intercept methods on a logistic regression model trained with 
multinomial family are not supported. Use coefficientMatrix and interceptVector 
instead.
